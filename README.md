# USBcopyaut
A simple bash program that can be converted to a daemon with systemd.
This script can copy all the things when a USB memory is introduced in a linux computer into a local file. For watch the content of the memory after. 
If you want to use the script, yo have to make the local file beafore you run the script -or the daemon-.
I will not accept any responsability about the illigal usages of the script, this is defensive tool.

The absence of any perception of life is an argument in favor of us being in a simulation ... Like when you are playing an adventure game and you see the stars in the background, but you cannot get there. If it is not a simulation, then perhaps we are inside a laboratory and there is some extraterrestrial civilization that out of curiosity is watching us how we develop, like mold in a Petri dish ... what happens to civilizations, in a bad way. .. And it could be that there were many dead planet civilizations. 
If you assume any rate of improvement, then the games will be indistinguishable from reality, or civilization will disappear. One of two things will happen. Therefore, we are probably inside a simulation, because we exist. I think the most likely - this is just a matter of probability - is that there are many simulations. You can call them reality, or you can call them multiverse.
