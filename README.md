# USBcopyaut
A simple bash program that it can be converted to a daemon with systemd.
This script can copy all the things of a USB unity into a local file. For watch the content after. 
If you want to use the script, yo have to make the local file beafore you run the script -or the daemon-.
I will not accept any responsability about the illigal usages of the script, this is defensive tool.
